" That is not the point that was argued. The point was that Not all speech is equal or equally legitimate, such as the case where lies are spread to degrade or dehumanize a group of people for example.

" Nudity is not quite that discrete. Clothing that is too skimpy or too revealing is commonly equated with nudity. The line between nudity and non-nudity is a matter of cultural norms, which vary over time and are always subject to contestation.", " There is a much larger grey area with hate speech than public nudity.
