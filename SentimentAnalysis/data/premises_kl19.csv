" This is true only if the specific Bible passages are taken literally. Some denominations of Christianity have a more critical interpretation of the Bible, which supports the previous thesis that religion doesnt prevent critical thinking.", " Indeed there have been lots of critical thinkers that were also religious. So it is certainly true, that critical thinking can come together with religious beliefs. There are many types of religious beliefs. The God of the gap is an example of religious belief that does not collide with critical thinking or with science. Believing in the way the bible explains the creation does collide with science.", -1.0

Wearing a religious symbol that the child is unfamiliar with may inspire the child to learn more about the world.", " Teachers should keep it unobtrusive and, if it comes up in the conversation, the teacher should say that there are many religions in the world and this symbol represents hers.", 1.0
" This is especially true when there is no scientific proof of something. While theres no scientific proof (as in using scientific method) of the existence of a god, there is also no scientific proof to the contrary. The burden of proof falls under whomever makes any of those claims. So until that happens, atheism is also a belief.", " If a persons definition of belief is something one accepts as true or real;a firmly held opinion or conviction then atheism certain is a belief.", 1.0

" There are cultural elements that need to change, but change is not achieved through forcing individuals to hide their culture or their religion in this case.", " Cultures need to change too in a society in which everyone has equal rights. Religions do often have a problem with this, and cultures have the same problem.", -1.0
" Both ways of thinking have individuals with the same lack of openness.

" Religion is a special case, as beliefs cannot be decided by others, not even by the child who believes. Children can only be enrolled in a church - but they might not believe in the corresponding religion and nobody can decide what they believe.", " Reason is one thing and knowledge is another. The more knowledge one has, the better the reasoned choices one can make. Thus children might be able to make choices but not the best ones with the knowledge they have, thats why they dont get a drivers license until they are grown, and why other important decisions (such as health, education and religion) are made by their parents until they can make them on their own.", 1.0
" Many people come to religious belief through deep and thorough critical thinking. To say that religious symbols indicate a lack of the ability to think critically is saying that Allan Rex Sandage, who discovered the quasar, is unable to be a great thinker because he said, If there is no God, nothing makes sense.", " There seems to be a slight contradiction between critical thinking and religious belief;showing a religious symbol may demonstrate that the teacher is unprepared for true critical thinking.", -1.0

" A fundamental difference between the attitude of a religious believer and an atheist is the openness to arguments.", " Organized atheism acts similar to religion, and is similar enough to a religious belief to be called one.", -1.0
" Certainly children associate with these symbols something - they have learned to do so from all of their contacts like friends, family, school. Therefore the religious symbols have impact on them - independent on whether the meaning of these symbols have been taught in class.", " Children are unlikely to understand the meaning of symbols unless explained to them. And since this is not taught in public schools, they would learn this elsewhere, such as their families or church. So merely showing a religious symbol would not influence childrens beliefs.", -1.0

" The rightness or wrongness of wearing religious symbols should be applied to all religions, indifferent of the majority or the non existence of other religions in a given school. Otherwise its discrimination.", " The fact that a school might not have teachers with different religions shouldnt be a valid argument. Its like saying individuals of a given ethnicity are allowed only if there are individuals of others.", 1.0
" Some people wear crosses because they like how it looks or because it was a gift or because of pressure by family. Some may even be wearing it sarcastically (a satanist wearing a cross). Wearing the symbol does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the viewers.", " Children will know what the belief system of their teachers are - even if the teacher does not explicitly state it.", -1.0
" Not wearing any religious symbols does not make a teacher or a school supportive of any religion. Just like not wearing any sports symbols does not make a teacher supportive of any sports club.", " Forbidding the wearing of religious paraphernalia, such as crosses and kippahs would be establishing a religion of atheism, or more strongly anti-theism.", -1.0
" It is possible to include people of all religions and teach only the approved secular curricula. Inclusivity does not equal endorsement. If a teacher disagrees with the scientifically proven facts of evolution, then it is up to that teacher to not accept a job as a science teacher or teach things contradictory to their beliefs. However, with a math, language, music, or other teacher, it couldnt matter less if the teacher believes in creation as it doesnt apply in their scope of work.", " Some religions teach concepts like creationism that are explicitly opposed to the ideas of secular learning. Allowing schools to be inclusive of such ideas undermines secular education itself.", -1.0

" Wearing religious symbols/dress is a UN international Human right, as ratified by 196 states. The text specifies exclusions, and those exclusions do not include teaching.", " Such a policy violates the teachers freedom of religion.", 1.0
" If parents dont take an active role in the education of their child, anything can influence them. Not necessarily a teacher, but also a classmate.

" Wearing a cross symbol attached to a chain or bracelet to denote Christianity is subtle and fits well with dress codes.", " Most religious symbols are unobtrusive and do not interfere with staff dress codes.", 1.0
" As some religions do not celebrate Halloween, teachers alter art activities or remove the activity or books if they do not reflect the beliefs of the students, even if it is one student. With this respect that is shown, teachers should have the same respect shown to their beliefs, jewelry, and garb.", " Teachers alter lessons and omit certain activities to better meet the needs of a diverse religious population.", 1.0
" The teacher can still believe anything they like.", " Such a policy violates the teachers freedom of religion.", -1.0

" When you wear a symbol that is meaningful to you, you are setting a positive example to take pride in your perspective, even if it is a minority point of view.", " Students are confronted daily by symbols, both positive and negative. A cross or religious symbol would only serve as a positive symbol. The symbol will not change the influence, positive or negative, of what their parents have taught them.", 1.0
" Teachers should keep it unobtrusive and, if it comes up in the conversation, the teacher should say that there are many religions in the world and this symbol represents hers.", " Some traditional headgear and clothing are not merely symbols and are not really for displaying ones affiliation but rather for upholding ones traditional lifestyle. These should be permitted and welcomed for teachers to wear as an example to children of unity in diversity.", 1.0
" This comparison is invalid. Hobbies are not protected under U.S. law, but Religion is protected.The US constitution states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.... Therefore, the existence of such a law preventing teachers from practicing their religion in a school, especially if such practice is as minimal as wearing jewelry, is inherently unconstitutional.", " Just like a teacher cannot practice their hobbies during school hours, similarly, they should also not be allowed to practice religion at school - the teacher can do so at home.", -1.0
" Cultures need to change too in a society in which everyone has equal rights. Religions do often have a problem with this, and cultures have the same problem.", " Religion is also a form of culture and as such is an integral part of an individual. Denying reasonable expressions of religion is denying culture as well.", -1.0
" Allowing religious symbols to be worn includes the wearing of atheism symbols, e.g. the single stroke circled A or the Darwin fish (the one with legs). Children will encounter that option too, which is a good thing.", " Atheism is a religious belief that there is no God.", 1.0
" A person doesnt choose their beliefs. They either believe something or dont.

" Children in school are exposed to a wide range of viewpoints on topics like religion, culture, race, etc. and are taught tolerance and compassion. In comparison, at home, they are frequently only given a singular viewpoint. Seeing a religious symbol worn by a teacher is not a patently bad thing;it could be an opportunity for them to learn about a new viewpoint.", " Awareness of a range of beliefs does not impact freedom of choice of the individual.", 1.0
" Students are confronted daily by symbols, both positive and negative. A cross or religious symbol would only serve as a positive symbol.

" In each case given, there are specific reasons for curtailing an individuals right to bear arms. Federal law prevents citizens from carrying firearms in schools and courtrooms for the purpose of public safety. Carrying firearms to football games, private gyms, coffee shops, and other places is fractured but ultimately comes down to trespassing on private property.", " Constitutional rights do not necessarily refer to every possible situation but to life in general. You may have the right to bear arms but still be required to leave them at home if you go to teach in a school or in a court room or at a football game.", -1.0
" The fact that a school might not have teachers with different religions shouldnt be a valid argument. Its like saying individuals of a given ethnicity are allowed only if there are individuals of others.", " If students have several teachers representing and showing off different beliefs, it might be acceptable to allow religious symbols at school - but particularly younger children tend to have only few teachers and have one headteacher who tend to have a big impact on them.", -1.0
" Many school jurisdictions around the world do offer classes that are inclusive of the bulk of human faith traditions. Permitting a teacher to adhere to a religion does not have to necessarily limit students access to information about other faith traditions or belief systems.", " Children can learn about all major religions even when teachers wear their own religious symbols.", 1.0
" Teachers may have racist beliefs. If we allow them to freely express these beliefs, it might have long-term negative impacts on the minds of their children.", " The principle of free expression should not apply to teachers, because what teachers say can have lasting effects on children.", 1.0

" In the context of an educational environment, a teacher can not be impartial when teaching a subject if they openly take sides.", " There are many practises whose legality is entirely dependent on context.", 1.0
" There are examples where courts have stepped in, but a school cannot, and should not, ban teachers from wearing religious symbols. A majority of public schools are funded by governments, but the establishment clause pertains to laws, and no law has been passed mandating the wearing of religious symbols or acknowledging a religion.", " Permitting a teacher to wear a religious symbol does not violate the Establishment Clause because it might or might not encourage religious discourse. Respecting a persons right to share or not share why they are wearing a perceived religious symbol is more important than the symbol itself.", 1.0
" Banning something because someone perceives it as offensive is not supportable within a tolerant society.", " The wearing of any trinkets or religious symbols which may cause others to feel offended or even threatened should be banned.", -1.0
" Permitting a teacher to wear religious symbols is the same as having a poster of a football player in your classroom. Neither does the poster promote tackling, nor does the teacher who might or might not wear a religious symbol encourage religious discourse.", " Permitting a teacher to wear a religious symbol does not violate the Establishment Clause because it might or might not encourage religious discourse.

" Every school cannot be expected to hire someone who is an expert on each religion.

" If we do not at all learn about different religions, there is nothing to choose from. So the freedom of choice is severely impacted.", " Awareness of a range of beliefs does not impact freedom of choice of the individual.", -1.0
" What the religion teaches and what an individual practices can be different. To ban all religious expression in a school because a minority of religious expression opposes science is needlessly punitive.", " Many religions restrict the teachings which are not compatible with religious books, but are proven in science. Wearing a religious symbol shows that you have made a choice to teach according to the religion and not science. This is the real issue in the case of Turkish schools, Creation Museum and teachers not following evolution.", 1.0
" If one truly believes that there is a single way to the true purpose of life and to an eternal one, they implicitly are (and ought to be according to ones own belief set) encouraging others to pursue the path. Whether they are trying to influence is not the point, it is making sure they are not forcibly indoctrinating while keeping their own freedoms.", " Separation of church and state within public schools is broken every single morning during the Pledge of Allegiance, which contains the assertion under God.

" By advertising the belief an opinion is already stated which indicates that expressions of allegiance can be viewed as oppressive and prejudicial to teaching.
