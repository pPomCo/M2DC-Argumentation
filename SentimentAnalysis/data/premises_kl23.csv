" The EU referendum is a profound constitutional issue that has been resolved;any final Brexit deal is not constitutional, its a policy.", " It would be wrong to put any final deal to the UK electorate in a national referendum. Referenda should only be used for profound constitutional matters, like changing the voting system or Scotland seeking to be an independent country. Policy matters are second-order issues as they can be changed via a general election.", 1.0
" The 2016 referendum opened a real constitutional crisis as the parliament is unable to agree and each main party is deeply divided. Not only was the referendum questionable (Electoral Commission ruling) but the result could break the United Kingdom. Two of its nations voted to remain while two voted to leave.", " It would be wrong to put any final deal to the UK electorate in a national referendum.

" The UK already had a seat at the top table and was unable to effect any meaningful change.", " History has already shown this view to be inaccurate, as the UK was unable to effect change while within the EU, and unlikely to effect the desired outcome, as no meaningful restructuring or reformation has occurred under any existing member.", 1.0
" Another example of working minimum majority rules are quorum rules, for example the Bavarian rules for a Volksentscheid on changes to the Bavarian constitution require at least 25% yes votes of the entire electorate. Its the same basic principle as quoted elseswhere on this kialo board", " One could make the same mandate for any Democratic vote then, in which case, the UK (and almost every other western democracy) would come to a screeching halt, as there has almost never been votes with such clear majorities, with only three examples coming to mind.", -1.0
" As the replacement treaty hadnt been written before EURef16 the referendum referenced in the text could not have been the pre-legislative advisory non-binding poll of 2016.", " The European Union Act of 2011 - Part1, Section2, SubSection2, C -  states that any treaty replacing/amending the TFEU/TEU cannot be ratified unless the majority of those voting in the referendum are in favour of the ratification of the treaty.", 1.0
" One example for such a minimum majority clause is the German 5%-clause. It is serving the country well and does its job: establish stable majorities. Ref.

" A third minimum-majority rule is frequent at German universities: quoting from memory, as a rule, professors, staff and students get two seats each at a facultys senate (or however this institution is called in proper English, and dont pin me down on the details, they dont matter here anyhow). However, the second seat is void if less than 50% of the electorate cast a vote.", " One could make the same mandate for any Democratic vote then, in which case, the UK (and almost every other western democracy) would come to a screeching halt, as there has almost never been votes with such clear majorities, with only three examples coming to mind.", -1.0

It now is up to Parliament to investigate and agree or disagree with them to deliver the best for the U.K. No additional referendum is needed. The people can oppose the decision in the next General Election.", 1.0
" It is not the case that the act requires a referendum;according to part 1, section 2, subsection 1, c either the referendum case or the exemption case must be met. Since any replacing treaty would most likely not meet any of the requirements for a referendum set out in part 1, section 4 (which all relate to increased EU power over the UK) the exemption clause could be invoked and no referendum would be required.", " The European Union Act of 2011 - Part1, Section2, SubSection2, C -  states that any treaty replacing/amending the TFEU/TEU cannot be ratified unless the majority of those voting in the referendum are in favour of the ratification of the treaty.", -1.0
" What it was doesnt imply what it should be. The parent argument used should, validated by the significance of the outcome. The preference of the population is not clearly stated in a rounded-up 50-50 vote.", " But there was no minimum majority required. The original referendum is valid, now the question is how to go forward.The result of a vote is the official proxy for the preference of the population.", -1.0
" The UK has thrown its weight around in the past, often without any meaningful effect, other than to annoy and aggravate its European partners.

" Non-specialists are prone to not have creative doubt and approaching a topic from a neutral stance.

" EU made clear the Switzerland model is not up for negotiation.", " Hannan quite clearly states no-one is suggesting we wouldnt have the same kind of deal that Switzerland has, or the Channel Islands have, in other words the free movement of goods, services and capital but living under our own laws.", -1.0
" This is not how democracy works. People, as UK citizens, regardless of where they live, should be allowed to vote and choose how to vote;regardless of their reasons, this is a fundamental principle of democracy.", " One could argue that they have a vested self-interest for their own good as expats, rather than in national interests and the best for others and the country as a whole. This might be seen as a reason why their vote should be excluded.", -1.0
" If 52% of Leave voters wanted different forms of a Brexit, yet the outcome is for example a no-deal Brexit, then it is not democratic to enact it, nor is it intellectually honest to claim 52% of voters would have voted that way if they knew this outcome.", " Referendum votes are based on subjective reasoning.

" Equally, a Peoples Vote may yet be held, which may contradict the original referendum.", " The 2016 referendum cannot truthfully be described as the final vote on whether Brexit will happen, because the 2016 referendum was non-binding and advisory.

" Far more Brits who live abroad live outside the EU than inside the EU, so it a priori seems unlikely they will have a pro-EU preference given this means that the UK will be forced to discriminate against the country in which they live.", " A pro-EU preference for those living abroad may instead indicate that those who have chosen to live abroad are more open to cultural exchange and freedom of movement, both of which were arguments for Remain.", -1.0
" Those that have come out to suggest that they broke the law and that it influenced the vote have questionable motives and motivations at best. This makes what they say somewhat difficult to believe at best.", " If a lawbreaker thought they gained from breaking the rules, surely people should err on the side of assuming they were correct.", -1.0
" Damage limitation is an argument that stands well on its own merits.", " Existing damage isnt an argument for limiting further damages.", -1.0
" The preferences of the population are subject to change.

" People are not homogeneous classes, but individuals that vary significantly per topic, despite showing rough trends of common overall knowledge. Distinction of personal topic-specific knowledge is affected by personal experience, location, country, household income, hobbies, etc.", " Having a full cross section of citizens ensures that everyone full understands the final decision.

" If a lawbreaker thought they gained from breaking the rules, surely people should err on the side of assuming they were correct.", " There is undisputed evidence that the Leave campaign believed it influenced the result of the referendum. If they didnt believe it would affect the result, they would hardly have risked breaking rules to do so.", 1.0
" Toyota, Nissan, Bmw (by Mini production), JLR , PSA Group (by Vauxhall), and other carmakers warned of moving business because of Brexit. Honda claimed they didnt leave because of Brexit, yet have warned of related concerns back in September 2018.", " International businesses (such as Airbus Wing production) will relocate to EU countries if trade is restricted between the Union and the UK.", 1.0
" If people had an admittedly clear understanding of what the status quo looked like and opted to vote against it even for a somewhat blind alternative, that actually is an argument in *favor* of the strength of the leave vote.", " The remain option was well defined and people knew fairly well what this result would mean. Leave was defined differently by campaigners and voters leaving it far more open to misrepresentations.", -1.0
" The needs of the majority dont align with their vote at a campaigned election/referendum due to incomplete information and lacking knowledge.", " The government is obliged to serve the needs of the majority of people but as not everyone votes, the system depends on a majority of those who do, and in order to support this claim, every person affected must be given the vote. Otherwise that vote is prejudicial and not democratic. If votes are denied to some citizens affected by decisions, then the vote should be declared invalid and not acted upon.", -1.0
" Hannan quite clearly states no-one is suggesting we wouldnt have the same kind of deal that Switzerland has, or the Channel Islands have, in other words the free movement of goods, services and capital but living under our own laws.", " Farage et al did not make it appear we could stay in the single market. The video cited above uses selective editing to lie about what was being said by those leave campaigners. Anatomy of a smear is an expose. The propaganda machine is gearing up to manipulate people who voted remain.", -1.0
" It is said that two wrongs do not make a right. Thus if the first should never have been offered, a second cannot do better, and will not lead to any constructive outcomes either.", " If that is true, then the first referendum should never have been offered in the first place. So a second might actually convey a more accurate picture of voter feeling, now that people are generally more aware of the technicalities and issues with trade relations, that have arisen.", -1.0
" Existing damage isnt an argument for limiting further damages.", " Some companies and private institutions have already moved capital and staff out of the UK or have revised future investment/production plans.", -1.0

Not once every 4-5 years.", -1.0
" Ruining the prospects of millions of young people, even if true, while tragic, is not grounds to illegitimize a democratic vote.", " In light of the true nature of Brexit being revealed, pushing on and leaving regardless will ruin the prospects of millions of young people, which is morally indefensible.", -1.0
" Some people voted to Leave in the Brexit vote as a protest vote agains the Conservative government, not believing that the results would really fall with the Leave campaign overall.", " It is not obvious that the majority of the population really wants Brexit to happen.", 1.0
" Napoleon and Hitler had the exact same goal, but through military, rather than political and economic means. The parent essentially makes the argument that they should not have been opposed.", " Brexit should be reconsidered because it will diminish peoples effort to stand in a peaceful and prosperous continent without borders and conflicts. EU is a unique experiment of people from different cultures sharing human values and human rights.

" Referendum votes are based on subjective reasoning. If carrying out the result of a referendum does not respect the exact reasoning for a majority of voters, then it does not respect the actual will of the people.", " It is not the goal of referendums to take a collective decision. The goal of a referendum is to identify support for a position, not to decide the position.

" If it annulled Article 50, the EU would have no incentive or reason to negotiate. The EU would offer no deal and instead see it as British capitulation. There would be no reform.", " The government would have far more leverage in negotiations if they annulled the Article 50 notice. If the EU does not offer a good deal it can refuse to leave and instead focus on drawing attention to and reforming the EUs failings.", -1.0
" If the demographics and opinions of people have shifted (ie the average level of Euroscepticism has fallen) then definitively something has changed.", " This however is true of every election or referendum ever. The decisions people make now will always affect future people and generations who have no say in the now. It was true of the first referendum too. Using it as an excuse for a second referendum as if something has changed is disingenuous.", -1.0

" Public Good games show rational individuals to most commonly end up seeking self-interest, not socially optimal outcome. If the Pareto outcome was achievable, it would be already implemented in politics, which would render this framework obsolete. Both require the same assumption, yet governments would provide a higher benefit.", " Having a well informed group of citizens with no vested interest in the outcome beyond helping their fellow citizens would be worth the expense.", -1.0
" Part of the delay was due to the time it took the EU to schedule pre-negotiations. It was therefore not in the British politicians power to speed up the process any more than they did.", " If the opinion of the vote counted, the Brexit could have just been implemented completely one day after the vote, but it did not really happen until now, exempt from some pre-negotiations. The long negotiations by politicians are not creating the result of the actual vote.", -1.0
" The Tories won the last election with 40% of the vote on a no deal is better than a bad deal manifesto, suggesting it is not at all certain that a bad deal offered by the EU would be accepted.  The EU is aware of this, and therefore could well be motivated by the prospect of a popular vote on whether to accept the offer or reject it and leave without a deal than they would otherwise.", " A second referendum on the final agreement for Brexit would weaken the UK governments negotiating position now. EU side would be motivated to give UK a poor deal knowing that this would likely be rejected by a vote, and UK would be forced to stay a member for longer or leave with no deal.", 1.0
" On immigration policy, Daniel Hannan concluded that it doesnt mean free movement of people, but free movement of labor, it doesnt mean EU citizenship with all the acquired rights.", " Every prominent Brexiteer said that a vote to leave would be a vote to end free movement of people. The EU has made clear that free movement of people must be accepted by countries in the single market. The single market must therefore be left.", -1.0
" A pro-EU preference for those living abroad may instead indicate that those who have chosen to live abroad are more open to cultural exchange and freedom of movement, both of which were arguments for Remain.", " If people who have lived outside the UK for 15 years were more pro-EU than those who have lived in the UK over this period (which hasnt been established) it would indicate that the lived experience of being in Britain over this period and dealing with practical issues caused by the EU has been negative.", -1.0
" Politicians have not been elected upon their specific aim for Brexit, therefore their election is not representative of the divided public opinion.", " Politicians are accountable every time there are elections. People can always choose to vote for a different representative, or standing as a candidate themselves.", -1.0
" Project fear was the leave capaigners go-to accusation and their followers disregarded any warning as non-credible, relying only on promises and optimism. One proof of the bias being proven wrong and project fear- correct are the companies moving out.", " Non-experts tend to exhibit cognitive bias and treat any given information through it. No democratically meaningful decision can be made from a biased treatment of information.", 1.0
" There were strong claims by leave campaigners that Britain could remain in the single market and adopt a Norway or Switzerland option, and without leave voters who believed these reassurances, leave may not have won.", " Politicians are accountable every time there are elections. People can always choose to vote for a different representative, or standing as a candidate themselves.", -1.0
" Throwing good money after bad is generally considered unwise.", " Even if no-deal does not happen, preparations for it have and are imposing costs on businesses and even the military. If it does not come to these reserves, they would simply be sunk costs.", -1.0
" It is implicit that the term overrule is used to mean make irrelevant, irrespective of the actual outcome. Holding a second referendum is either the most democratic thing to do, or it isnt - what anyone believes the outcome will be is irrelevant.", " Stating that a second vote would overule the first vote is admitting that the majority are now in favour of remaining. If that is the belief, then holding another referendum is the most democratic thing to do. A democracy enables the electorate to change their minds.", -1.0
" This defeats the very notion and concept of democracy and would ensure a politicians career is at best, brief.", " Governments are obligated to act in the best interest of their country, not necessarily the majority.", -1.0
" Representative democracy works exactly in that fashion- elected officials collect more information, are more educated in specific fields and can better estimate results and choose the most advantageous path. It is peoples responsibility to request accountability and control for abuse.", " Democracy cannot work if there is no wisdom in the crowd since constraining important decisions to a class of elites is equivalent to creating a noble class which is the antithesis of democracy.", -1.0
" Voters do, however, now know exactly how badly each of the referendum campaigns distorted the truth in their original campaign. Since largely the same people have remained as spokespeople for each point of view, they can now be judged on their actions and the results of the last two years, not just by vague promises that didnt have to be backed by results.", " There is no reason to believe that calling a second referendum would give voters enough precedence to make a more educated decision.", -1.0

" It is dangerous to outright ignore a voting cycle, especially if the decision does in fact change. Due process must be followed first.", " This event will likely dictate international relations for generations to come. It is only fair that the British people (especially younger generations) get to vote on those terms.", -1.0
" Many leading Leave campaigners including Farage, Boris, Hannan, Fox and Davies stated that the UK would most likely remain in the single market.", " In a poll 2 weeks after the referendum, 61% of Leave voters said that they expected us to remain in the Single Market (p. 17).", 1.0
" Switzerland does it all the time. In the most recent vote the Swiss considered (and rejected) yet another attempt to torpedo bilateral relations with the EU.", " You cant keep on re-doing the same referendum if you dont like the outcome.", -1.0
" Having a balanced jury of all levels of competency would ensure the people under the Dunning-Kruger effect are weeded out by their fellow jurors.", " Dunning–Kruger effect renders juries open to negotiation and seeking synthesis of a socially optimal decision.

" One could argue that they have a vested self-interest for their own good as expats, rather than in national interests and the best for others and the country as a whole. This might be seen as a reason why their vote should be excluded.", " It is reasonable to assume that someone living in the EU would be supportive of retaining the right to do so. British citizens living in the EU are among the most directly affected and should have been eligible to vote regardless of time outside the UK, especially as they are ineligible to vote in elections in their country of residence.", -1.0
" Current technology does not make trade in goods possible, so the Irish border is a deal-breaker for the Canada scenario and provokes local violence.", " Canada deal still posts the Irish border issue, doesnt cover a big portion of services access, doesnt provide financial access. While Canadas trade is mainly in narrow fields of goods, UKs trade with the EU is much higher, wider variety of fields in goods and significantly affected by services.", 1.0

" The expose focuses on an irrelevant differentiation and misses the point. Hannan ensured participation in the Single Market. To the voters full membership vs Norway access is mostly irrelevant in terms of welfare, which is what affects them. The changed position contrasts not in regards to membership vs access, but in regards to availability of promised continuation of trade. That is in fact inconsistent.", " Farage et al did not make it appear we could stay in the single market.

The propaganda machine is gearing up to manipulate people who voted remain.", -1.0
" This would only work if there hadnt been 2 years of people who voted to leave being accused of being racists and xenophobes.
