" This should not happen at the expense of a countrys sovereignty, as happened in the case of Greece ever since the first memorandum in 2010. In detail, according to the Greek Loan Facility Agreement of 2010, and more specifically, in article 14, paragraph 4, the Hellenic Republic denounced any form of immunity (as a consequence of its sovereignty) regarding this agreement, in respect of itself or its aspects.", " Since a debt crisis in one Euro country has ability to affect all other Euro countries, such a crisis should be handled by institutions representing the entire Eurozone.", -1.0
" The market tends to treat Greek, German, French and Irish banks all very differently. This would not be the case (or at least not to the same degree) if the ECB really was viewed as the guarantor of banks all across the eurozone.", " In the eurozone, even though the ECB has implemented limited bail outs of banks in some cases, the market still tends to view national governments as the overall guarantors of a countrys banking system, meaning they are more threatened by the prospect of a runs on their banks in the event of economic shock.", 1.0
" Since a debt crisis in one Euro country has ability to affect all other Euro countries, such a crisis should be handled by institutions representing the entire Eurozone.", " The majority of these officials were not appointed by the Greek government, which is the only government elected to represent the Greek people who were the ones affected by their debt crisis.", -1.0
" The increasing purchasing power of the euro is only a problem because of Greeces minimum wage. Without it, an increase in the euros purchasing power would be met by employees bidding down wages until an equilibrium was reached.", " In a monetary union and single market, the purchasing power of a currency is determined (to an extent) between all countries rather than within a country. Thus a Greek euro is worth more in PPP terms while a German euro is worth less, leading to wages that are more or less expensive relative to what a national currency would offer.", -1.0
" The difference is that when countries have their own currency there are usually political mechanisms to redistribute resources to compensate for this undervaluation and over valuation. This is not true in the Eurozone.", " Undervaluation and overvaluation on the regional level is a feature of all currencies. Stronger regions (such as a capital city) will always be undervalued by whatever currency is in place, while rural areas will always be overvalued.", -1.0
" In the eurozone, even though the ECB has implemented limited bail outs of banks in some cases, the market still tends to view national governments as the overall guarantors of a countrys banking system, meaning they are more threatened by the prospect of a runs on their banks in the event of economic shock.", " In the US, runs on local or regional banks are less likely because the market knows that these banks will generally be guaranteed at a federal level.", 1.0
" Within individual countries, redistribution and government investment can be deployed to correct for some regions being harmed by devaluation. This is not possible in the Eurozone because there is no political union.", " This is also the case for any currency on regional level;even with a local currency in each country you will have a region that would appreciate devaluation and one that will be harmed by it. The Euro is not different in that regard from having national currencies.", 1.0
" The majority of these officials were not appointed by the Greek government, which is the only government elected to represent the Greek people who were the ones affected by their debt crisis.", " Each of the members of the executive boards of the troika institutions are appointed by the elected representatives of the member nations, meaning that they are ultimately elected by a democratically accountable process. In this way they are no less democratically representative than other officials within the EU or even national officials such as supreme court justices, police commissioners, or attorney generals (depending on the country).", -1.0
" Schengen Agreement eliminates first and foremost the need for border checks amongst members of the EU (Including EEA members), to begin with. Visa-free travel is already guaranteed by being a member of European Union. For instance, travelling between Bulgaria and Romania, two countries not participating in the Schengen Area, are having visa free border checks amongst them.", " Visas have traditionally served as one of the biggest barriers to travel. The Schengen Agreement eliminates the requirement for them.", -1.0
" The effects of the financial crisis on the eurozone created huge amounts of distrust and suspicion between Greece and Germany.", " The euro has been a flash point that has created tension between lots of EU countries. If anything, it has reduced trust and made cooperation on other issues less likely.", 1.0
" Most Europeans are never asked whether they want most of their countrys laws and policies implemented. Rather, they delegate that power to their democratically elected representatives. In this case, those representatives did decide that they wanted to join the euro.", " Most Europeans were never asked whether they wanted the Euro.", -1.0
" Relative overvaluing also raises the prices of imports into peripheral nations, hurting their ability to industrialize and grow.", " With the euro averaging its value across the member states, it is undervalued from the perspective of high-value exporters such as Germany, meaning their exports are artificially cheaper for international buyers.", -1.0
" The ECBs stance on inflation, that the focus should always be on keeping it as low as possibly whilst essentially ignoring unemployment, tends to reflect that of Germany rather than any other Eurozone country.", " The ECB is de facto dependent on Germany, even if it is de jure independent.", 1.0
" Germany has stated it will stop all arms trade with the KSA until such time that action is taken to redress the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.", " Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.", 1.0
" This could be avoided by bilateral/multilateral agreements on economic cooperation between various states, in which a certain exchange rate could be set either for the whole of their economic relations or for specific sectors and products. Combined with a clearing system between these parties, it is obvious that no fluctuations should be expected, because everything will be already set and if needed to change, this will be made by the parties-states themselves, in any way they deem acceptable.", " Transactions which occur in two or more currencies are complicated by a risk that any of the currencies involved may change in value.", -1.0
" The UK and France are two of the largest weapons sellers to the KSA, a monarchy with a terrible human rights record.", " Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.", -1.0
" Russia, unlike Hungary, is sanctioned by Western states.", " The exclusion is not comparable, as unlike Russia, Hungary is a member of NATO and is viewed as a full member of the Western bloc despite the differences in opinion under the Orb√°n regime.", 1.0
" The US is an outlier trailing most mature democracies concerning voter turn out.", " If most mature democracies have similar rates of voter participation, it implies that these rates are the norms of democratic participation as opposed to a deficit.", -1.0
" Economic stagnation in the periphery can lead to instability that can threaten the core Eurozone countries as well. This means that even if the ECB is controlled by Germany, there will always be an incentive to avoid this unless it is absolutely necessary.", " The ECB has no incentive to purposely cause economic stagnation in the periphery, so austerity measures are likely to only be imposed when public spending is unsustainably high.", 1.0
" If a country is hit hard economically, like the periphery of the eurozone was after the financial crash, a large devaluation can be a very useful response as it can increase competitiveness and make the value of exports cheaper. The problem was, and still is, that this scale of devaluation will never be in the interest of stronger economies. Since they have no need to boost competitiveness, the effect would just be lowering wages for no real reason.", " This did not go nearly far enough as the fundamental problem remains that the scale of devaluation that countries like Greece or Portugal have needed will always be counter to the interest of stronger economies like Germany.", 1.0
" The policies followed by central banks after the 2007-2008 crisis, and more specifically the ones followed by the ECB, have been politically incentivised, so as to we should review the idea of bank sovereignty altogether. Yet, as this requires a (theoretically) full economic union and the fact that this option is neither favoured, nor wanted, nor even beneficial, we should review this within the framework of national central banks. For more, see amongst others this paper, as well as this book.", " The fundamental distance should not be the problem as monetary policy is supposed to be for the benefit of society as a whole. The ECB is not supposed to represent european citizens but has one fundamental goal: to maintain price stability (attained by economic growth and stable employment rates). This is (supposed to be) uninfluenced by any political policy (and thus democratic elections) as there was a consensus that price stability is beneficial for society.", -1.0
" Currency devaluation does not prevent states from also using all those mechanisms mentioned to create a holistic and effective policy.", " Currency devaluation does not adequately address supply shocks, political demands, government corruption and so forth, all of which work in tandem during economic crisis. So devaluing the currency only pushes the problem away for a later date, making it much worse in the long run.", -1.0
" Outside of being pegged to a second currency or good such as gold there is no objective measure of the value of a currency. The euro is neither so cannot be under-valued whether Germany wants to do so or not.", " With the euro averaging its value across the member states, it is undervalued from the perspective of high-value exporters such as Germany, meaning their exports are artificially cheaper for international buyers.", -1.0
" Outside of being pegged to a second currency or good such as gold there is no objective measure of the value of a currency. The euro is neither so cannot be under-valued whether Germany wants to do so or not.", " With the euro averaging its value across the member states, it is overvalued from the perspective of low-value exporters and tourist-heavy economies such as Greece, meaning that their exports and holiday experiences are artificially more dear for international buyers.", -1.0
" This is also the case for any currency on regional level;even with a local currency in each country you will have a region that would appreciate devaluation and one that will be harmed by it. The Euro is not different in that regard from having national currencies.", " The common currency means that countries with weak economies cannot devalue their currencies relative to stronger economies to increase competitiveness, thus favouring the latter.", -1.0
" Each of the members of the executive boards of the troika institutions are appointed by the elected representatives of the member nations, meaning that they are ultimately elected by a democratically accountable process. In this way they are no less democratically representative than other officials within the EU or even national officials such as supreme court justices, police commissioners, or attorney generals (depending on the country).", " The Greek debt crisis was primarily handled by the so-called troika, which consisted of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary fund - none of which are democratically elected.", -1.0
" Germany provides the largest amount of capital to the ECB.", " The ECB is de facto dependent on Germany, even if it is de jure independent.", 1.0
" The issue is not that the ECB actively wants to cause economic stagnation, but rather that it has such an ideological commitment to the idea that austerity is the only policy option that it is blinded to other possible solutions.", " The ECB has no incentive to purposely cause economic stagnation in the periphery, so austerity measures are likely to only be imposed when public spending is unsustainably high.", -1.0
" The US is of comparable size to the eurozone, yet it manages to weather asymmetric and localised shocks.", " Since it is comparatively bigger than most other currency areas, the Eurozone is prone to asymmetric shocks that would require locally coordinated and appropriate policy responses.", -1.0
" Political pressure tends to be election-focused and thus incentivised to address short-term issues. Without the ability to value long-term planning there is little to incentivise central banks to run counter-cyclical monetary policy.", " Allowing interest rates to be dictated by the usual democratic pressures would lead to inconsistent and disastrous monetary policy.", 1.0
" As the nation with the largest private lending market within the Eurozone, Germany can influence the votes of other members.", " The ECB is de facto dependent on Germany, even if it is de jure independent.", 1.0
" In spite of the fact that most Britons oppose the arms trade with the KSA, it continues. This implies that vocal populations have proven ineffective in checking the West meaningfully.", " Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.", -1.0
" Apparently not, as entering the Economic and Monetary Union is a condicio sine qua non, but for Denmark and the United Kingdom, for all member states of the European Union. Even if these countries had this option, this by no means equals that this was a real choice or rather a fake dilema that actually does not exist.", " They are faced with these options as a result of their primary decision to join the union in the first place (while knowing the requirements and details of the system). Complaining about the options afterwards is proof of the failure of short-term thinking by many politicians, not proof of the Central Bank being evil.", -1.0
" Greece borrowed directly from member-states rather than the ECB. The European Stability Mechanism managed those funds, which specifically did not allocate money to addressing unemployment.", " Free trade roughly matches two (capital-goods/labor mobility) of the 4 optimal currency-area criteria. The elephant missing from the room is the risk sharing system. Keynes proved that markets cannot irrationally move against falling-wages/unemployment and/or shrinking money-supply. ECB is crippled by its founding regulations on that front, as it cannot fund any failing state.", 1.0
" 1.3 billion internal border crossings are made through the Schengen Area every year.", " The Schengen Agreement was critical in integrating EU states. Without such integration the Euro would not have been nearly as successful.", 1.0
" Representative democracy, rather than direct democracy, is the predominant form of democratic rule. Under such a system politicians are given the (temporary) authority to do what they believe is right rather than what is vox populi of the moment.", " Then German chancellor Helmut Kohl knew that the Euro did not have popular support when it was introduced. He pushed for it because he thought it was right, not because it was backed by the sovereign, the people.", -1.0
" In a monetary union and single market, the purchasing power of a currency is determined (to an extent) between all countries rather than within a country. Thus a Greek euro is worth more in PPP terms while a German euro is worth less, leading to wages that are more or less expensive relative to what a national currency would offer.", " The euro means that wages in countries such as Greece are artificially high something that has contributed to large amounts of unemployment.", 1.0
" Ideologically the central bank is a result of capitalistic evolution. The fiscal discipline (Stability and Growth Pact) on the other hand was a political choice (although also neoliberal). The Central Bank acts as enforcer of this agreement in the same way the judicial system has the authority to deploy sentences. However because of the separation of duties, the Central Bank (or the German Bundesbank) cannot be said to be the one who made this agreement/law.", " This is because the ECB has been ideologically captured by the German Bundesbank, which sees the euro as a means to enforce fiscal discipline upon other eurozone countries (Stiglitz, 2016, p.145-174)", -1.0
" The euro has become a central site of Franco-German disagreement and rivalry.", " The euro has been a flash point that has created tension between lots of EU countries. If anything, it has reduced trust and made cooperation on other issues less likely.", 1.0

" The US, UK, and France have far less media censorship compared to Russia.", " Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.", 1.0
" Germany could not have acquired such a huge trade surplus under a less rigid exchange rate systems ‚Äî the Deutschmark would have appreciated and made their exports more expensive.", " With the euro averaging its value across the member states, it is undervalued from the perspective of high-value exporters such as Germany, meaning their exports are artificially cheaper for international buyers.", 1.0
" The fact that the ECB was willing to utilise quantitative easing shows that it is more flexible than commonly thought and suggests that it can take action that benefits the eurozone as a whole and not just the core countries.", " The euro was bound to have teething problems, and most of the issues that exist currently can be fixed.", 1.0
" In the US, if an economic shock hits one part of the country this can be at least mitigated to a large degree by redirecting significant amounts of the federal budget to that area and funding this through taxation of areas with stringer economies. The provision to do this in the eurozone is extremely limited given the lack of a political union.", " The US is of comparable size to the eurozone, yet it manages to weather asymmetric and localised shocks.", -1.0

The provision to do this in the eurozone is extremely limited given the lack of a political union.", " The eurozone does not need to possess all the features of an optimal currency area, but at present it has far fewer than functional currency areas of comparable size and nature. An example of this is the USA, which may lack some of the features that define an optimal currency area, but still has more than the eurozone does.", 1.0
" The whole point of monetaty policy is to reduce the negative effects of such adjusment on the population. It is heartless to want people to suffer for moral arguments on what is economically right", " Unemployment brought about by economic shock will drive down wages, which means for investors a euro in real terms will go further in Greece than it will in Germany. This is in effect a naturally occurring devaluation and brings about an increase in competitiveness that can aid recovery from the economic shock.", -1.0
" In the US, runs on local or regional banks are less likely because the market knows that these banks will generally be guaranteed at a federal level.", " The eurozone does not need to possess all the features of an optimal currency area, but at present it has far fewer than functional currency areas of comparable size and nature. An example of this is the USA, which may lack some of the features that define an optimal currency area, but still has more than the eurozone does.", 1.0
" Devaluing a currency in order to create competitiveness isnt a good idea. There isnt any European country that can compete with nations such as China on cost. Competing on quality is what makes European exports competitive and this is clear in countries such as Germany and Italy.", " The common currency means that countries with weak economies cannot devalue their currencies relative to stronger economies to increase competitiveness, thus favouring the latter.", -1.0
" Greeces high unemployment is better explained by a shrinking public sector, economic mismanagement and an unrealistic expectation of returns from higher education.", " The euro means that wages in countries such as Greece are artificially high something that has contributed to large amounts of unemployment.", -1.0
" Only if one assumes free movement of capital or strong unilateral debt restructuring.", " Abolishing the euro now would lead to an extreme economic and banking crisis for poorer countries.", -1.0
" The euro has been implemented but the so called harmonization isnt truely here at least yet which means this isnt true when buying goods nor when searching for jobs. Prices are very different and sallaries are very different.", " The shared and consistent value of the euro means that it is easier to compare prices and buyers can be more confident in the prices they see abroad.", -1.0
" The levels of redistribution in the EU are relatively low (0.2% of GDP);much lower than between US states.", " The EU has some degree of revenue sharing within its currency area, with the largest share of its budget going towards creating growth/jobs and reducing economic gaps between the EUs various regions.", -1.0
" It is not clear that the euro specifically is responsible for that. Thanks to things like the single market and the customs union, the EU was already heavily economically integrated before the euro was introduced, and it is this more than anything that has prevented war between EU member states.", " The shared euro makes armed conflict between member states almost non-existent. What ever the economic downside of a shared currency, it is more than outweighed by the benefits of not being at war.", -1.0
" Who is to decide who is to be trusted in determining a nations direction if not its citizens. This kind of point of view is profoundly undemocratic and only fosters opposition to the European project", " Many countries cannot be trusted to use monetary policy responsibly. It is better that they be forced to suffer through market discipline and adjustment, when devaluation often just risks even greater economic ruin at a later date.", -1.0
" The Schengen Agreement was critical in integrating EU states. Without such integration the Euro would not have been nearly as successful.", " All travel benefits provided by the euro were contingent on the Schengen agreement, which is therefore a much more significant factor in increasing the ease of travel within Europe.", 1.0
" The criteria for entry into the eurozone too weak, and were fudged to allow some key countries to join - notably Italy. But, now its here it would be massively damaging to go back. The big issue is that while there is monetary union there is no fiscal union. If fiscal policy was set centrally, much in the same way as in the USA, then a lot of issues with the euro would go away.", " Any unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy is bound to be unstable. Unifying fiscal policy would result in the creation of one, European state.", -1.0
" Currency devaluation does not adequately address supply shocks, political demands, government corruption and so forth, all of which work in tandem during economic crisis. So devaluing the currency only pushes the problem away for a later date, making it much worse in the long run.", " Without the ability to devalue their currency, countries are unable to boost their competitiveness by reducing the (relative) cost of their wages.", -1.0
" Even though these budgetary limits exist, many members of the union were not in compliance at the start. This contradication is the source of all problems at the moment. Also the existence of the stability and growth pact should be the main topic of the argument as most people dont seem to see the difference between the central bank and the laws under which it operates.", " The eurozone has strict budgetary limits that mean debt-to-GDP ratios cannot exceed 60%.", -1.0
" Since EU businesses primarily operate using the Euro, day-to-day fluctuations in the euros value are less of a concern.", " A single currency eliminates currency risk.", 1.0
" Greece has a huge culture of Tax Evasion which it has been reluctant to tackle, as well as hiding its debt from the EU when it joined. The EU could not afford to continue bailing out Greece to the cost of other nation states when it made no real attempt at tackling its own economic problems.", " Germany has been the principal force behind EU austerity measures throughout the Eurozone, particularly in Greece.", -1.0
" Economies may differ but this has to be worked out towards a general unification. Cultural, language and social differences must also be bridged and combined. This combination and fermentation of diversity is the major advantage of unification and this combination should be promoted and built upon. It should note be the excuse for fragmentation and isolation.", " Todays perspective on the euro is a snapshot in the middle of a project for a generation. It may feel like a mistake today (March 18), but we dont know how it is going to turn out in the long term.", 1.0
" Most Europeans were never asked whether they wanted the Euro.", " Even the euros origins are deeply undemocratic.", 1.0
" The ECB has no incentive to purposely cause economic stagnation in the periphery, so austerity measures are likely to only be imposed when public spending is unsustainably high.", " The economic and policy leverage that other members of the eurozone exert means that they can enforce harmful austerity policies on other countries that are counterproductive to their economic recovery.", -1.0
" European States (i.e. national governments) should not try to unify monitary and fiscal policies. Government should manage budget within the fiscal policy provided by parliament and leave monetary policy to central bank. This process has worked effectively in the United States, which actually are separate states but with political unification and  separate fiscal policies.", " Any unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy is bound to be unstable. Unifying fiscal policy would result in the creation of one, European state.", -1.0
" Different currencies for international trade favor Currency Wars and maneuvers that benefit the super rich and international traders but greatlyharm the buying power of the lower classes.

" As of November 2017 only 6 of 18 Eurozone states are compliant with this rule.", " The eurozone has strict budgetary limits that mean annual deficits cannot exceed 3% of GDP.", -1.0
" The economic interdependence created by the euro has facilitated more cooperation and has made political integration more likely further down the line.", " By creating economic interdependence, members of the EU are more willing to cooperate on other issues.", 1.0
" Wage increases caused by inflation and devaluation would initially have been nominal rather than real, but inflation also increases competitiveness by making exports cheaper relative to other countries. This gradually brings about real rather than nominal gains to the economy.", " Before the euro inflation was high in many countries. Workers were deceived by the perception of nominal wage increases that did not correspond to real increases.", -1.0
" Even though both Russia and the West have done this, the West has a check on this through vocal populations who protest the backing of dictators.", " Western Europe has also backed dictatorships and leaders wanted for war crimes by the international community.", -1.0
" The Euro was accepted more readily in places where people already identified less strongly with their home country, while countries with a stronger sense of national identity, like the UK, refused to sign onto it (Risse 2003, p. 487).", " Currencies are an important part of national identities and the euro was crucial in establishing a collective European identity, stabilising the EU in the long run.", -1.0
" On the other hand, fiscal policy involves the ability for a government to tax and to spend. If Eurozone fiscal policy is consolidated, then only the Eurozones overarching government would be able to spend and tax, essentially replacing independent national governments.", " Any unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy is bound to be unstable. Unifying fiscal policy would result in the creation of one, European state.", 1.0
" There is a potential collective action problem whereby countries keep manipulating their currencies in order to compete with one another thereby facilitating a race to the bottom in terms of currency value. The centralised control of monetary policy that the euro provides prevents this.", " The euro should be maintained so countries within the euro zone are not tempted to compete by manipulating their currency. Currency is a utility. It should not be used to artificially improve a nations economic competitiveness.", 1.0

" This is dis-analogous because in most other democratic states with their own currency monetary policy is dictated by unelected central bankers, with democratically elected finance ministers in charge of fiscal policy. Eurozone finance ministers still maintain control of their own countries fiscal policies.", " As opposed to the previous European national currencies, the Euro does not have a democratically elected finance minister.", -1.0

" A currencys value remaining high and being resilient to country-specific economic shocks is not an inherent good. A drop in the value of a currency can be an important market adjustment in response to a crash, and preventing this from happening can distort economic conditions even more.", " By having so many countries share the same currency, its value is more resilient to country-specific economic shocks because their affects can be absorbed across the entire euro area.", -1.0
" The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker said, ‚ÄúLess Schengen means less employment, less economic growth.

" The main reason that devaluation is a useful policy response to economic shock is that it increases competitiveness and makes exports cheaper relative to other countries. The ECBs quantitative easing will never be as effective as devaluation in specific countries because it is applied across the eurozone generally.", " Collective responses to these slumps can often still be found. For example, up until recently the ECB practiced a large scale policy of quantitative easing to help ease the effects of recent economic shocks.", -1.0
" There are two main types of economic regulation: fiscal and monetary. Independent countries use both to achieve intended effects. However, the nations of the Eurozone have different goals. As monetary policy is unified with a unified currency, they must use fiscal policy, which affects the same currency in opposite directions, satisfying no parties.", " Any unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy is bound to be unstable. Unifying fiscal policy would result in the creation of one, European state.", 1.0

Hungarians might therefore be better prepared to cooperate with Russia than Western Europe, especially the more senior generations.", -1.0
" The ECB is independent. This guarantees stability, which has made the euro a success, but it also controversial because its monetary policy cannot be used as a tool in politics. Neither the ECB nor the national central banks (NCBs), nor any member of their decision-making bodies, are allowed to seek or take instructions from EU institutions or bodies, from any government of an EU Member State or from any other body.", " The European Central Bank is not only independent from a national government, but independent from any particular country within the eurozone.
