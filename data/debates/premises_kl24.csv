" Making plans while alive for what happens to ones body falls under opting-out of being a donor. Bodily autonomy ceases on death, but decisions taken while alive do not expire.", " This is highly contentious. One can easily make plans whilst still alive for what happens to ones body;to say it simply ceases the moment life does is to undermine the autonomy held while alive.", -1.0
" Precisely because of the arguably worse consequences of inaction on this front, people are much less likely to forget to opt-out if they have an active aversion to organ donation.", " Equally, many people who dont want to donate may forget to opt-out. The consequences of this possibility are arguably graver than of forgetting to opt-in.", -1.0
" Some people think their sons should be circumcised, but assuming the parent does unless they specify they dont would cause problems. Ultimately, a supernatural belief should be opt-in, and assuming the body is sacred makes that belief an opt-out.", " Some people think their body is sacred and that should be respected.", -1.0
" There are many legal ways to contest a will. Lawyers could undoubtedly draft such a process to legally contest an organ donation.", " If a deceased family member was opposed to donation, they would have said so prior to death. Assuming the opinions of a dead person is bizarre, particularly if their action or lack of action indicates a different opinion.", -1.0
" 6,300 people died in the US in 2006 while waiting for an organ transplant.", " There is a shortage of organ donations in most countries.", 1.0
" Post-mortem examination is usually carried out in order to convict the person responsible for some crime. If not convicted, said person could cause harm to other people, therefore protecting their well-being should be considered more important than protecting deceaseds (familys) religious wishes.", " With the same logic performing a post mortem would also need to be considered the same.", -1.0
" Equally, many people who dont want to donate may forget to opt-out. The consequences of this possibility are arguably graver than of forgetting to opt-in.", " Many people who might want to donate simply forget to sign up.", -1.0
" Medical autonomy is reached at the age of sixteen. It merely requires a letter in the post to inform those who are being automatically opted-in;they can then take whatever action they consider necessary.", " This can be easily averted by announcing the opt-out system well in advance of it entering into force, and by public information/education messages. That way everyone has the chance to opt-out before they are automatically opted in.", 1.0
" Nor should the voices of those who do not support it, if fewer in number, outweight those who support it. People who do not support it will still be able to deny donating their organs by opting-out of the program.", " This doesnt eliminate the voices of those who do not support it, and whose reservations deserve to be given weight.", -1.0
" People living and then dying has been the nature of life so far. There is no moral imperative that demands this to remain so now or in the future, no reason why death should not be postponed even indefinitely. Life expectancy was 26 years in the bronze age. In that sense we are already way past what was considered natural for our ancestors.", " People live and then they die, that is the nature of life. Due to technological advances, bodies can be kept alive almost independent of the vitality inside. Next to expensive, this keeping-people-alive-no-matter-what can also get ethically questionable, for example when life extension is nothing more than prolonged suffering. Therefore, instead of sacrificing ethical standards to stretch life, society might benefit more from clear policies on when to intervene and when not to.", -1.0
" If this is such a vital issue, then it the individuals responsibility to ensure they have not been signed up.", " Even with wide reaching information campaigns, there is the risk that some people opposed to donating organs will not realise they are opted in.", -1.0

" For opt-in by default to be morally acceptable, there would have to be a near certainty that every person that could be affected by this had actually made a conscious choice regarding the matter.", " Someone who is opposed may pass away before having the opportunity to opt out (unexpected or untimely death).", 1.0
" Medical personnel does not have access to the information whether the patient is or isnt an organ donor prior to the patient being declared brain dead, thus eliminating the possibility of mistreatment of such patient.", " Possibility for ethical issues for medical personnel, for example in an instance where potentially not reviving a patient with viable/donate-able organs would benefit other patients waiting for compatible organ donation.", -1.0

" For you to be a you (and therefore maintain ownership) you need to be a sentient being. When we die, we cease to be sentient and we lose ownership of everything we own, including our bodies.
