" Getting out of a marriage is more difficult than getting out of an informal relationship due to the stigma involved with being a divorcee and legal issues. Therefore, even though marriages may not exclusively provide partners, they provide partners that are going to comparatively stay in the relationship for a longer duration of time.", " Having a partner is not contingent on marriage, people can cohabitate.", -1.0
" Having a partner is not contingent on marriage, people can cohabitate.", " Marriage provides individuals, especially parents, with useful support networks that may not exist otherwise. Having a partner eases the process of caring for a child.", -1.0

Having a partner eases the process of caring for a child.", 1.0
" Military service is disanalogous. Joining the military is only analogous to intercourse in cases when the woman intends to become a mother if she becomes pregnant, as the recruit is signing up for the military with the intent to fight should war be declared. A woman can consent to sex without intending to mother a child, while a recruit cannot join the military without the intention to defend the country.", " People who sign up for military service in peacetime do consent to fight in a war that might break out, even though this is not inevitable.", -1.0

" Having a partner care for a child partially or fully allows women to focus on things such as an education or their career, as women do not have to prioritize the needs of their child over their own desires and care for them all the time.", " Marriage provides individuals, especially parents, with useful support networks that may not exist otherwise. Having a partner eases the process of caring for a child.", 1.0
" This may be theoretically possible, but such legislation is unlikely to be passed in states controlled by Tea Party Republicans whose base primarily consists of religious voters who are opposed to such education.", " The lack of sexual education points to the fact that states must be compelled to provide sexual education. It does not lead to the conclusion that the right to abortion must be provided.", -1.0
" The natural consequence and biological purpose of sex is pregnancy, we do in fact have to accept the biological and natural consequences of our actions.  Not all actions result consequences that directly related to its natural or biological purpose.", " This acceptance bears no ethical weight, otherwise we would have to accuse people of accepting every conceivable consequence of any given action, and that is absurd.", -1.0

" If labels are difficult to understand, perhaps the best solution to the problem is making them easier to understand rather than allowing abortions.", " Labels with birth control are known to be difficult to understand and are often not updated at the same rate as medical knowledge.", -1.0
" The United States has imprisoned at least one woman for this without evidence to suggest that she caused the miscarriage.", " It is absurd to assign blame to a woman who has had a miscarriage if she didnt do anything to cause that miscarriage. In many instances the woman wants a child who dies in the womb. Even if the fetus has a right to life, most societies wouldnt imprison a woman for miscarrying.", -1.0
" An Australian study of women in their 70s found that single women without children had the fewest diagnoses of major illnesses, the healthiest body mass index and were least likely to smoke, as compared to married women, or woman who had been married in the past.", " Marriage is not a requirement to having a fulfilling life and a happy family.", 1.0
" People who sign up for military service in peacetime do consent to fight in a war that might break out, even though this is not inevitable.", " The boxer example is disanalogous. A boxer knows that their opponent punching them in a ring is inevitable. Pregnancy due to sex on the other hand is a possibility. Individuals consent to inevitable outcomes of actions rather than possible outcomes.", -1.0
" This is assuming the person taking the contraceptives was aware of the failure rate.", " Taking steps to mitigate the risk of an unwanted outcome does not remove the causality with regards to the consequences. It may reduce moral responsibility, but it does not free anyone from all liability. Her choices still caused the pregnancy even with contraception, and she knew in advance that she could still become pregnant. Therefore, contraception failure is a known risk that the woman willingly took.", -1.0
" A lack of accurate information on contraception techniques and their use on the internet suggests that states must try to police information concerning contraceptives. It does not lead to the conclusion, however that women should be allowed to access abortion.", " For those who do get information online they are likely to get incorrect information. Anyone can post online, information is not policed and so people can be easily mislead.", -1.0
" Women can always choose to access government websites or websites run by international organisations like the United Nations for accurate information.", " For those who do get information online they are likely to get incorrect information.

" Children of divorced parents are 50 percent more likely to have health problems.", " Divorce impacts the couple and any children they may have negatively.", 1.0
" Since abortion is illegal in Ireland, it is impossible to know accurate abortion figures in Ireland. Thus, it is futile to compare figures from Ireland with those of a country where abortion is legal and  the majority of abortions are documented.", " That number does not come close to enough to explaining the disparity between Irelands abortion rate and the UKs abortion rate, even when including documented black market abortions in Ireland.So either all (or almost all) the women who make up the disparity got one on the black market, and it wasnt documented (there is absolutely no evidence of that), or Irelands abortion ban is reasonably effective.", -1.0
" This acceptance bears no ethical weight, otherwise we would have to accuse people of accepting every conceivable consequence of any given action, and that is absurd.", " The consent to sexual intercourse cannot be separated from the consent to consequences of that intercourse. Even though (correctly) using contraceptives shows the intent to avoid pregnancy, the woman still accepts pregnancy as a possible consequence of her actions.", -1.0
" According to The Positive Effects of Marriage by Patrick Fagan, a child in a single parent household is 14 times more likely to suffer physical abuse than a child living with married biological parents. Children who live with one parent and that parents partner are 33 times more likely to suffer physical abuse.", " Marriage is not a requirement to having a fulfilling life and a happy family.", -1.0
" In this scenario abortion would be a legitimate response as the women who is pregnant would have to pay for her abortion and so pay for the consequences in the same way that these other examples would.", " This logic only dictates that we should not subsidize their health care, not that they should not be able to buy it. Letting people suffer the consequences in this case means that if people choose to go without health insurance, or take risks that are not covered by the insurance, nobody should be forced to pay for their health care, even if that means they do not get treatment.", -1.0
" A study found that children from traditional nuclear families were more likely to graduate from high school and complete college compared to those who were raised in blended or single-parent homes.", " Marriage is not a requirement to having a fulfilling life and a happy family.", -1.0
" There is no denying a plurality of madhab (schools of thought) in both Shia and Sunni branches of Islam. There also exists differences of opinion between scholars of the same school. However the majority view today in terms of sheer numbers among practitioners of the faith, for both Sunni and Shia, is the aforementioned view of abortion as permissible only when there is an imminent risk to the mothers health. It is therefore prudent to act as though this view represents Islam as a whole.", " It is assumed that there exists such a thing as unified Islamic jurisprudence. In reality, there are different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.", -1.0
" The Maliki position prohibits an abortion after implantation has taken place, while the Shafii school maintains that at any stage after fertilization the zygote should not be disturbed, and interference with its development would be a sin.", " It is assumed that there exists such a thing as unified Islamic jurisprudence. In reality, there are different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.", 1.0
" The Hanafi school is flexible on abortion. It specifies that before the fourth month of pregnancy, an abortion may be induced if a womans pregnancy poses a threat to the life of her already existing infant.", " It is assumed that there exists such a thing as unified Islamic jurisprudence. In reality, there are different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.", 1.0
" If we accepted that using contraception means that the sexual partners do not consent to parenthood, and would not hold them responsible for the fruit of their loins, then this would mean that men could unilaterally opt out of parenthood as well as women. However, this is not generally accepted.", " The consent to sexual intercourse cannot be separated from the consent to consequences of that intercourse. Even though (correctly) using contraceptives shows the intent to avoid pregnancy, the woman still accepts pregnancy as a possible consequence of her actions.", 1.0
" Labels related to a lot of products are difficult to understand.

" The lack of sexual education points to the fact that states must be compelled to provide sexual education. It does not lead to the conclusion that the right to abortion must be provided.", " Only 24 States in America mandate sexual education. 4 States require parental consent before a child can engage in this education and 35 states allow a parent to opt their child out of it. This shows that many children do not have access to sexual education in school in the US.", -1.0
" Shiite schools allow for abortion before 4 months of pregnancy. They allow for it if the mothers life is in danger or will be made extremely difficult due to the birth of the child. They have also allowed for abortion in the case of rape.", " It is assumed that there exists such a thing as unified Islamic jurisprudence. In reality, there are different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.", 1.0
" Pew Research shows that over half of the children living with married parents were in households with incomes at least 200% above the poverty line. At the same time, only 21% of children living in single-parent households lived in households with an income at 200% above the poverty line.", " Marriage is not a requirement to having a fulfilling life and a happy family.", -1.0
" Any system of risk-pooling should be set up so that nobody can offload the cost of their personal risks on others against their will. Insurance is based on assessing the individual risk accurately and basing the premiums on that risk assessment, or even rejecting the application if the risk is too high. Otherwise, you would have to overcharge low-risk people in order to subsidize high-risk people, which requires coercion and leads to people taking higher risks because it costs them nothing.", " This logic only dictates that we should not subsidize their health care, not that they should not be able to buy it. Letting people suffer the consequences in this case means that if people choose to go without health insurance, or take risks that are not covered by the insurance, nobody should be forced to pay for their health care, even if that means they do not get treatment.", 1.0

" There is a difference between engaging in risky activities and consenting to injuries or negative outcomes. There have been cases of Boxers suing due to injuries which occurred as part of a boxing match. One such example is Prichard Colons $50 million lawsuit after he ended up in a coma after a boxing match.", " A boxer who enters the ring willingly also accepts that he will be hurt during the fight. He cannot claim self-defense if he shoots his opponent to stop the beating, because he consented to fight according to the rules.", -1.0
" It is common knowledge that smoking can lead to numerous health issues. Warning labels on cigarette packets make the risks associated with smoking even more explicit.

" It is assumed that there exists such a thing as unified Islamic jurisprudence. In reality, there are different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.", " Under Islamic jurisprudence, the fetus doesnt have all the rights of a person but its right to life is only disregarded if there is a danger to the mothers health. The reasoning is that since the mother is a full person, she already has relations and duties in the world, for example, her family or work and that the fetus is not absolutely comparable. It is important to note this distinction cannot be used as a blanket justification for abortion under any condition.", -1.0
" If conscientious objection is indeed widespread enough to meaningfully restrict access to abortions, then banning it would have a large impact on supply and negatively impact women’s ability to find affordable care. Therefore, doctors should not be required to perform abortions.", " More likely, those particular individuals will choose specialities where they are unlikely to be asked to perform an abortion, and the marginal decrease in competitiveness for the specialities that do carry a likelihood of that will draw those who might have chosen other specialities to those fields. This is unlikely to have an effect on the quality of medical care available after that self-sorting.", -1.0
" While discrimination against patients based on their vaccination status is not per se illegal, it would be illegal if this refusal is based on religious beliefs. By the same logic, inferring someones sexual behaviour from their race, gender or religion and then refusing them as a patient on those grounds would likely also be considered discrimination.", " In the US, doctors who receive federal funding are prohibited by the Civil Rights Act from discriminating against patients based on race, color, religion, or national origin.", 1.0
" It can be taken from this claim that the unplanned pregnancy is the legal guardians fault. If this is the case then both minors involved in the pregnancy would not be required to deal with the consequences. Abortion in this case would then be justified as the pregnancy is not the pregnant minors fault.", " If a minor is not competent to have sex responsibly, then the legal guardians have the duty to prevent them from engaging in sex at all. Furthermore, it is the parents duty to educate their children about how to best deal with their sexual urges and members of the opposite sex in general, among many other things. Therefore, even in cases of teenage pregnancy, it is somebodys fault.", -1.0
" One of the reasons women may not want to be single mothers is the lack of financial support from the government, which could easily be mitigated through policy changes.", " Women do not have abortions due to a fear of current or future socioeconomic circumstances alone. 48% of women had abortions because they did not want to be single mothers or were having relationship problems. Governments may be able to help mothers get education and jobs but they can not regulate against this. (Finer et al;p.g 1)", -1.0

" This takes a toll on family life as parents can not spend much time with their children.", " In order to sustain low income, especially single parent families women might have to work two jobs at a time or work longer hours.", 1.0
" However, the innocent child could not object to this. Fetuses are human and deserve the right to life, a right that should surpass all other rights.", " Milluzzos choice should have been respected whether the doctor believed it was correct or not.", -1.0
" One might assume death to be the ultimate deterrent, yet there is no evidence that the death penalty deters crime.", " Social observation allows us to acquire fears without ever being personally exposed to the aversive stimulus.", -1.0
" There are many instances in which consent cannot be revoked unilaterally, because others depend on the commitment. If the dependent party cannot or will not release the other from a commitment, we have to weigh the cost of fulfilling it against the cost that reneging on it would put on others. Since the fetus life depends on staying in the womb, while carrying the child to term is usually just an inconvenience to the mother, it is justified to prohibit withdrawal of consent in this case.", " Consent can be revoked at any time. In relation to the woman, if we are to assume she implies consent to the child through her sexual activity, this implied consent can at any point be revoked. Once consent is revoked the foetus does not have a right to the mothers body.", -1.0
" If the number of conscientious objectors is small, their withdrawal from the market has little impact on the supply of doctors for women. Allowing them to refuse to perform abortions doesnt affect the women and, given their care isnt impacted, the doctors should not be required to carry out abortion procedures.", " More likely, those particular individuals will choose specialities where they are unlikely to be asked to perform an abortion, and the marginal decrease in competitiveness for the specialities that do carry a likelihood of that will draw those who might have chosen other specialities to those fields. This is unlikely to have an effect on the quality of medical care available after that self-sorting.", -1.0
" If, for example, a Doctor believes that abstinence based education is morally good because it avoids unwanted pregnancies, they should revise their belief in the morality of abstinence based education if it turns out it is not the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies.", " Questions of morality, religious freedom, and legal ethics should be at least partly rooted in evidence. If one believes that the answers to these questions will, in fact, change the world in a certain manner then evidence provides a way of falsifying that belief.", 1.0
" However, there is a difference between behavioral altruism and moral altruism. Sentient creatures understand and create moral standards, while nonsentient creatures behave altruistically without thinking about it. Humans develop standards when they develop the capacity to remember and familiarize with a beneficial action. It becomes moral when the action is standardized as good (moral +) or bad (moral -).", " There are many evolutionary theories backing this up showing that altruism in early hunter gatherers was the earliest form of morality, far before religion had an influence.", -1.0
" By using contraceptives, a woman is clearly refusing consent for her body to be involved in a childs development. Whether this contraceptive works or not, her intent has been made clear.", " Just because known risks to certain actions exist does not mean that individuals consent to them. A woman may know that contraception may fail. In the instance that it does fail, she is clearly not responsible for carrying the fetus to term because she withdrew consent to motherhood before intercourse and took measures to prevent a pregnancy.", 1.0
" By using contraceptives, a woman is clearly refusing consent for her body to be involved in a childs development. Whether this contraceptive works or not, her intent has been made clear.", " This is not true in instances of faulty contraception.", 1.0
" Some people have found abstinence to have negative psychological affects due to the repression of their sexual urges.", " Avoiding sexual intercourse, by either refraining from sexual activity altogether, or by limiting oneself to other practices, is a simple and obvious way to avoid pregnancy.", -1.0

Information about the correct use of a particular contraceptive comes with the packaging, or can be obtained from the doctor prescribing it or the pharmacist selling it.", -1.0
" For every hundred couples using the pull out method four will get pregnant.", " Most of these methods are not a hundred per cent effective. Therefore there would still be a chance of pregnancy.", 1.0
" Empathy and compassion are virtues only in the context of reciprocal relationships. There are many cases in which helping another person will only drain your energy and resources, without improving the recipients life, because they do not wish to make the necessary changes.", " If we voluntarily allow people to suffer or even die by refusing aid we are providing a bad example for children and juveniles. Using these instances as a point of reference also teaches children lack of compassion and empathy.", -1.0
" Many professions are already subject to restrictions which society considers legitimate, such as a certain level of education, or conforming to certain ethical requirements.", " The European Union charter of fundamental human rights states, Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation.", -1.0

" Choosing to protect oneself from a low-paying career does not make murder justifiable.", " In order to claim self-defense, one must choose the mildest effective means available. Women can give their babies up for adoption, so abortion is not the mildest effective way to avoid the impact of motherhood, even after the woman has become pregnant. Therefore, abortion is not a legitimate means of self-defense against the financial losses that motherhood would entail.", 1.0
" If viability varies, the fair and moral answer is to not allow abortion at any point in the pregnancy.", " Fetal viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities that vary from country to country, from developed to developing nations. Therefore, a fetus may be viable at some stage in a country but may not be viable at the same stage in another country. Killing one while allowing the other to live cannot be moral. Viability thus cannot be a metric when it comes to deciding the morality of abortion.", -1.0
" This means that 39% of women who get an abortion in the US do not have children yet, which is still a substantial number.", " Childless couples are a poor control group, since the majority (61%) of women who get abortions in the US already have children.", -1.0
" Unscientific claims do not provide evidence, nor do they provide examples to suggest that they are legitimate. It is safe to assume they are illegitimate until proven legitimate.", " It is unclear why unscientific claims are illegitimate claims.", -1.0

" High birth rates in low income families are a problem. It becomes more difficult to improve material conditions and gain the benefits that accrue from that.", " The mere difference in childbirth rates between low and high income demographics does not imply that the high rates are a problem.", -1.0
" When you take an action, you have made a choice to act, as opposed to inaction. Seeking out an abortion is an action, whereas inaction would mean carrying the child to term and giving birth. The arrangement (or lack thereof) of prenatal care and the circumstances of the birth would be another set of choices, for which the woman will take her financial and social situation into account. There are many choices involved, and the woman has agency and autonomy with regards to these choices.", " Staying pregnant and carrying the child to term often comes with monetary or health costs that women may not be able to afford.

" If we take this claim as correct then it can be assumed that the legal guardians of the minor should bear responsibility for the pregnancy. As it is impossible for them to perform the pregnancy for them, paying and providing for an abortion or care of medical needs throughout the pregnancy would be the only way they can take responsibility.", " If a minor is not competent to have sex responsibly, then the legal guardians have the duty to prevent them from engaging in sex at all.

" Governments, like the Trump administration, that are closely associated with reducing funding for abortion services are also closely associated with reducing federal funding for welfare projects. It is unlikely that these governments will choose to redistribute money saved from abortion services to projects that specifically help women.", " Governments can choose to put money into social programs. They do not necessarily have to.", 1.0
" That number does not come close to enough to explaining the disparity between Irelands abortion rate and the UKs abortion rate, even when including documented black market abortions in Ireland.So either all (or almost all) the women who make up the disparity got one on the black market, and it wasnt documented (there is absolutely no evidence of that), or Irelands abortion ban is reasonably effective.", " Over 3,000 women reported an Irish address when seeking an abortion in England in 2016.", -1.0

Individuals may choose to ignore aspects of Christian doctrine, that does not take away from the fact that it is Christian doctrine.", -1.0
" In the USA the numbers are under 25% so less than 1 in 4. The idea that numbers make it acceptable is clearly false. If 1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted should we then says “Its so common we shouldn’t really consider it that bad”?", " Statistically, one in three women will have an abortion at some point in her life and there already is a lack of foster families. Hence, it is unlikely that there will be enough families to take in all the children that parents would rather have aborted.", -1.0
" An uncoerced decision requires the decision-maker to act voluntarily, free of coercion and pressures. In contrast, a coerced decision, by definition, means a distinct lack of choice.

" The view that only the immediate result determines the morality of an action or inaction is untenable, because it would lead to absurd moral judgments. For example, since the result of murder, negligent homicide and homicide in self defense have the same result, they would be morally equivalent.
