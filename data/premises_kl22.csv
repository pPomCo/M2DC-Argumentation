" As the oversight committee examines waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars;the realm of this oversight may extend to the office of the president, and/or the failure of congress to act against the president and perform their duty of oversight regarding presidential waste, frauds, or abuses of taxpayer dollars.", " This is not the jurisdiction of the oversight Committee. Its just a political maneuver to stir the pot. The Oversight Committee is for government spending, taxation and things that happen while in office. Cases like Bill Clintons activities while in AK were ruled out of jurisdiction during the whole Lewinsky incident as an example.", -1.0
" Enemies need not be bordered countries. Lies and deception, and other fraudulent acts, may constitute enemies of the people;whose needs Government is designed to serve.", " This claim is actually misleading. Legally, a country doesnt have to be at war, or in a state of open hostilities to name a country its enemy. It is enough for the Government and/or those in power and authority to consider something or someone an enemy for it to be so.", 1.0
" The cold war was not an actual physical war and there was no formal declaration, yet America would consider Russia its enemy in such a state or situation.", " This claim is actually misleading.

It is enough for the Government and/or those in power and authority to consider something or someone an enemy for it to be so.", 1.0
" The preceding claims that Trump should be impeach if it becomes the will of the majority are not attempts to follow the Impeachment process as designed. Applying it for purposes other than those enumerated (treason, bribery, crimes) is a clear abuse of power.", " Impeachment was established as a systemic check on the Presidency in the original text of the Constitution. Carrying out that procedure as designed can hardly be considered an abuse. Rather it is the system working as it was intended.", -1.0
" The government regularly names nations, states and individuals whom they name or declare as enemies, without declarations of war. A good example would be Iran, which America sees as an Enemy state, yet no formal state of war exists.", " This claim is actually misleading. Legally, a country doesnt have to be at war, or in a state of open hostilities to name a country its enemy. It is enough for the Government and/or those in power and authority to consider something or someone an enemy for it to be so.", 1.0
" As only two Presidents have ever been impeached, binding historical precedent has not been established.", " None of the other things Trump has done has been historically used to impeach a President.", -1.0
" Given their continued support in the face of a mess of self-contradictions in Trumps public policy actions and stances, it is reasonable to conclude that committed Trump supporters could only be blind adherents to a cult of personality.", " This assumes a blind tribalism among all Trump voters, many of whom were independent or voted for Trump because he did not campaign as a traditional Republican. Trump clearly delineated himself as something different than the status quo.", -1.0
" In fact, part of the reason that Mueller was appointed was because of reports that Trump had told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.", " Mueller was not appointed at the time. Mueller was only appointed by Rod Rosenstein after Trump fired Comey. So when Trump told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, he was talking to the person overseeing it.", 1.0
" Trumps lawyer is trying to classify the statement of liar as political opinion, additionally the cousin of Zervos has come forward to refute her previously.", " The problem here is that Nixon v. Fitzgerald (and the Constitution) are fuzzy on where exactly the duties of the President end. There are legitimate legal opinions which interpret these duties so broadly as to effectively immunize any sitting president from any lawsuit, and the courts have not really settled many questions on the matter. Zervos v. Trump, for example will set precedent on whether a sitting president can be sued in a state court.", -1.0
" If one places a ruler on a DJI chart at the start of Obamas term (6,627) to the end (20,810), one can see that the rise under Trump to March 5, 2018 is a continuation of the rise under Obama as that rise is almost exactly where it is now (24,875).", " Whether or not Obama caused the stock market to improve is irrelevant to the claim that Trump caused the stock market to improve.", -1.0

" Trump criticized Comey and highliged several things he felt were done wrong", " Trump once praised James Comey for his handling of the Clinton email case.", -1.0
" Its relevant in the case of the logic you applied where it pertains to not giving Trump credit. Either Obamas recovery started with Bush and Trumps recovery was due to Obama, or neither is the case.", " Whether or not Obama caused the stock market to improve is irrelevant to the claim that Trump caused the stock market to improve.", -1.0
" The popular vote is not currently, nor ever has been, the way the USA has elected a president.", " Although he was elected, he did not win the popular vote.", -1.0
" The US started a recovery late 2007, and have been on the same rate of growth since. This is an issue given the rate of recovery being so slow, tied with additional bureaucratic regulatory controls like DF , creation of complex health insurance bureaucratic rules and the push for the quantitative easing that artificially inflated stocks (filling the 1%s bank accounts while ripping off the lower/middle class).", " Unlike the Obama/Trump comparison, the economy was not already improving before Bush left office.", -1.0
" Under US Law, a country has to be engaged in hostilities to be classified as an enemy.", " The United States is currently not at war with Russia, so from a legal standpoint, they are not an enemy of the USA.", 1.0
" The Republican Party chose Trump. He is what they wanted. If he is bad for them, then they should reap what they have sown, politically-speaking.", " Many within the Republican party who supported Trump will suffer when the president is impeached.", -1.0
" Not impeaching Trump tells his voters that their candidate and the president can get away with impeachable offenses just because we are worried they might feel like their vote and opinions dont matter. Law and order should be chosen over opinions and bad votes.", " Impeaching Trump without any evidence of illegal activities would only prove to his supporters that their opinions and vote doesnt matter, further dividing the nation.", -1.0
" A single, egregious act can suffice to establish harassment.", " Harassment of an individual must be continual. If it is not alleged by the individuals that Trumps unwanted advances were continual over multiple instances, the allegations cannot be considered harassment by definition.", -1.0
" The United States is currently not at war with Russia, so from a legal standpoint, they are not an enemy of the USA.", " Many would define Russia as an enemy. And refusing to name them as a culprit, or conspiring with them, refusing to enact sanctions, would fall under comforting and aiding.", -1.0
" If there is a war in Europe, the United States will likely be pulled into the war, as it was in WWII. The cost of war to the US would be much higher than the cost of maintaining the status quo. Thus, it is in the US national interest to support institutions and processes that prevent extra-legal border changes.", " Russias invasion jeopardizes the acceptance of borders as set down after WWII. Resisting Russias extra-legal change to borders supports the status quo that has produced 75 years of peace in Europe.", 1.0
" The claim was that Trump admitted to doing it, not that he did it by means of talking about doing it.", " Talking about it is not actually doing it.", -1.0
" Given his impeachment is debatable at present, impeaching Trump now could rupture the American democracy, which is one of the few in the world which is stable after centuries.", " Trump was democratically elected and many Americans still support him.", 1.0
" An impeached president is not tried and convicted by a unanimous decision of a jury of his peers, but by a 2/3 vote of the Senate.", " Both protections and liabilities are drastically different for an impeached President than for a criminal defendant, indicating that impeachment is a peculiar institution, bound by its own norms, rather than an extension of criminal or civil justice.", 1.0

" The impeachment process is not handled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. While certain committees in either chamber may make non-binding recommendations, the only actions relevant to an impeachment outcome are (1) the entry of draft articles of impeachment into the hopper, (2) a simple majority vote of the House to adopt those articles, then (3) a 2/3 majority vote of the Senate to remove the President based on any one article.", " The basis was not on it being a political matter but nonjusticiable, as in not the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Issues of this nature are handled by the Senate Judiciary Committee, a legal arm of the Senate.", -1.0

" When a person engages in serial activity to harass multiple individuals, thus establishing a pattern of harassing behavior, it does not matter if each victim is distinct or if the behavior is repeated and impacts an individual victim multiple times. Harassment can be applied as a label to the perpetrator of patterned behavior, even when the perpetrator victimizes each person a single time.", " Harassment of an individual must be continual.

" Fear does not need to be the stance to operate from;however needlessly provoking the enemy to act in ways that might put innocent lives in danger, is not rational and is more risky than just letting things play out. Being firm and confident if fine, but being immature and cocky is unreasonable.", " Fear is not a position to negotiate from. As the US is the most powerful nation on the planet, placating dictators and aggressors because of their capabilities is a poor practice and belies this fact.", -1.0
" An appearance of interference is sufficient grounds to investigate underlying circumstances and assess whether a legal criminal case for obstruction of justice is appropriate", " An appearance of interference is not proof of interference.", -1.0

" Good journalism may require positing some critical position in order to evade the bias of the topic of report in order to remain unbiased. To put it another way, fair and balanced reporting requires critical thinking. While this may appear negative;it may be a balancing factor.", " Organizations such as the Media Research Center have found that the medias coverage of Trump was just as severely biased and negative in 2018 as it was in 2017.", -1.0
" Given the nature of investigations, the news medias opinions and what is public, it is understandable that it took 6 months for Trump to get enough information to make the decision.", " The Democrats who wanted James Comey dismissed wanted it solely because of how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton.

" This can be seen as an attempt at obstruction of justice. Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University, says Trump’s replacement of Sessions with Whitaker was arguably an impeachable offence in itself.", " Trump demanded the resignation of Sessions without giving any reason. While he does not have to give a reason, both the timing (right after appointment of Kavanaugh and the mid-term elections) and the replacement selected, (Matthew Whitaker, a vocal and public opponent of the Mueller probe who has proposed choking and scraping it), are deeply suspicious and troubling.", 1.0

" There is little evidence that increases in hate crimes are connected to political rhetoric. It may account for specific incidents (e.g. specific mass shootings where the intentions of shooter are known and a political influence is mentioned);however, we can’t conclude that political rhetoric is the sole reason for increases/decreases in hate crimes.", " During Obamas administration, however, the number of hate crime offenses overall fell;during Trumps administration, the number of offenses overall rose.", -1.0
" In such situations, prior actions, in so far as they constitute evidence of an ongoing plot or seditious conspiracy, are satisfactory to admit as evidence against the president.", " High crimes may be discovered only after the president takes office, and plots for power and influence may span many decades. It seems unlikely that actions taken in such plots prior to entering office would be immune from consideration during impeachment, even if the office and duties to the people were seemingly performed immaculately.", 1.0

" If we assume that Trump committed these actions in New York, they are a crime.  New York state law would define grabbing a woman by the p*ssy as forcible touching, a class A misdemeanour.  If Trump makes a habit of this behavior, it could be persistent sexual abuse, a Class E felony.  It is likely that other states also criminalize this sort of behavior.", " What Trump admitted to in the Access Hollywood Tape is not sexual harassment. Sexual harassment must involve a quid pro quo or a hostile work environment. The revelation of these discussions was embarrassing to candidate Trump but it is not sexual harassment and it is not a crime.", -1.0

" Noting the rate of growth/recovery, the economy improved more under Obama in any 5 years than under Bush from October 2002-2007 (between the two recessions).

" Trumps actions may damage important security and economic relationships with key allies and, during the time of Trumps tenure, these allies are forced to continue making economic and security decisions and relationships.  Trumps tenure at this time may force key allies to move toward other partners and away from America in ways that have permanent impacts on our security and prosperity.", " Trumps actions may send America into a spiraling decline, both at home and abroad, from which no revolutionary backlash, lessons learned, or future efforts could recover.", 1.0
" To personally benefit the few;by exacerbating a divisive political drama, while leaving the genuine needs of the entire country by the wayside is a violation of constitutionally defined presidential duties to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, where the law in question is the Constitution of the United States or otherwise.", " Even if Trump used these tactics and general intent by the Russians to divide our country for their own present and future gains (in markets or otherwise), it is the duty of a President to condemn these actions unilaterally, not merely where convenient for his campaign base.", 1.0
" Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Sean Hannity that Trump “fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.  He’s entitled to that.

Issues of this nature are handled by the Senate Judiciary Committee, a legal arm of the Senate.", " The basis for the Court applying the political question doctrine to impeachment is that impeachment is a political matter to be determined solely by Congress. Thus, while the Doctrine only applies to the Court, the basis for its application indicates that impeachment is inherently political rather than legal.", -1.0
" In this example, the person has already been found guilty of a crime by a jury, so the reporting requirement is an extension of the prior punishment.", " Having a criminal report weekly to his or her parole officer is a pretty solid example of holding someone accountable for potential actions.", -1.0
